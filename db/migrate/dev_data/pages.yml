           <p>Lake View Hill Park is 48.3 acres in size and is located on the north side of Madison, 1202 â€“ 1206 Northport Drive.</p>
           <p>(Check out the recent Survey of Lake View Hill Park, <A HREF="/files/Survey-page1.pdf">page 1</A> and <A HREF="/files/Survey-page2.pdf">page 2</A>)</p>
           <p>In 2006 the Dane County Board of Supervisors placed all 48 acres surrounding the Lake View Sanatorium, including Lakeview Woods behind it, and 5 acres donated by the children of John Esch, in permanent conservancy.  This preserves the property for public use as a park, except for the buildings, which may be used for county government.  Even the buildings are being preserved, since they have been placed in the National Register of Historic Places because the setting and the architecture show the early medical treatment for tuberculosis.</p>
           <p>Dane County opened the Lake View Sanatorium in 1930.  Like the TB sanatoriums of the time it was built on a setting that offered beautiful walks, fresh air, and separation of the contagious from the general  population.  It was one of the last TB sanatoriums built and operated until 1966, when antibiotics proved to be a more effective treatment than fresh air.  The county has renovated the main building and continues to use it for the Department of Human Services.  The former Nurses Dorm stores county records.</p>
           <p>The park offers passive recreation, walking the trails that were formerly used by the TB patients and viewing the City of Madison, Lake Mendota and the UW from one of the highest elevations in the county - 990 ft (near water tower).  Abundant wildlife and some rare species thrive in the woods.  The park also offers active restoration and educational activities organized by the Friends of Lake View Hill.  The front lawn is a popular place to fly kites, watch fireworks and go sledding.</p>
           <p>Every year the Friends of Lake View Hill sponsors a Clean Up the Hill Day on the Saturday before Earth Day.  The Parks Department provides trash bags and a dumpster and we usually work for about two hours starting at noon.  In addition there are volunteer activities throughout the year for surveying birds, butterflies and plants, brushing and seeding.  For more information about FOLVH activities call Nelson Eisman at 608-244-2055.</p>
